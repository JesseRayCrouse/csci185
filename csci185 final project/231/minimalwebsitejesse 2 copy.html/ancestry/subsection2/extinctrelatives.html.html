            <p>Based on fossil evidence from Russia and Bulgaria, the first known members of the family <i>Procyonidae </i> lived in Europe in the late <i>Oligocene</i> about 25 million years ago. Similar tooth and skull structures suggest <i>procyonids</i> and <i>weasels</i> share a common ancestor, but molecular analysis indicates a closer relationship between <i>raccoons</i> and <i>bears</i>. After the then-existing species crossed the Bering Strait at least six million years later in the early <i>Miocene</i>, the center of its distribution was probably in Central America. Coatis (Nasua and Nasuella) and raccoons (Procyon) have been considered to share common descent from a species in the genus <i>Paranasua</i> present between 5.2 and 6.0 million years ago. This assumption, based on morphological comparisons of fossils, conflicts with a 2006 genetic analysis which indicates raccoons are more closely related to ringtails. Unlike other <i>procyonids</i>, such as the crab-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus), the ancestors of the common raccoon left tropical and subtropical areas and migrated farther north about 2.5 million years ago, in a migration that has been confirmed by the discovery of fossils in the Great Plains dating back to the middle of the <i>Pliocene</i>.Its most recent ancestor was likely Procyon rexroadensis, a large Blancan raccoon from the Rexroad Formation characterized by its narrow back teeth and large lower jaw.</p>
