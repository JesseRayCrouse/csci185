                &nbsp; Raccoons are an amazing animal species that have the scientific&nbsp;name <i>Procyon Lotor</i>. a mammal native to North America. It is the largest of the <i>procyonid</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;family. having a body length of 40 to 70 cm (16 to 28 in), and a body weight of 5 to 26 kg (11 to 57 lb). Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur, which insulates it against cold weather. Three of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its <i>extremely dexterous front paws</i>, its <i>facial mask</i>, and its <i>ringed tail</i>

                The original habitats of the raccoon are <i>deciduous and mixed forests</i>, but due to their adaptability, they have extended their range to <i>mountainous areas, coastal marshes, and urban areas</i>, where some homeowners consider them to be <i>pests</i>. As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century, raccoons are now also distributed across central Europe, the Caucasus, and Japan.
