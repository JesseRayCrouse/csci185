<p>Based on fossil evidence from Russia and Bulgaria, the first known members of the family <i>Procyonidae </i> lived in Europe in the late <i>Oligocene</i> about 25 million years ago. Similar tooth and skull structures suggest <i>procyonids</i> and <i>weasels</i> share a common ancestor, but molecular analysis indicates a closer relationship between <i>Raccoons</i> and <i>bears</i>. After the then-existing species crossed the Bering Strait at least six million years later in the early <i>Miocene</i>, the center of its distribution was probably in Central America. Coatis (Nasua and Nasuella) and Raccoons (Procyon) have been considered to share common descent from a species in the genus <i>Paranasua</i> present between 5.2 and 6.0 million years ago. This assumption, based on morphological comparisons of fossils, conflicts with a 2006 genetic analysis which indicates Raccoons are more closely related to ringtails. </p>
